			<h1>Khaled Zraiqi</h1>
			<h2>Versitile game / backend developer</h2>
		</span>
		<p>
			My name's Khaled, and I am a 26-year-old aspiring game developer from Sweden.
			I have a higher vocational education in web development as a full-stack developer.
			I also have a big love for game development and have been working on projects in my spare time.
			I currently spend most of my spare time programming and trying to perfect my craft — something I'd like to say I'm slowly achieving.
			I dabble in most languages, so I am very versatile and ready to do some on-the-fly learning!
			My biggest strength is my ability to learn and adapt to new situations and challenges.
			Please check out my projects below and feel free to contact me if you have any questions or want to work with me!

						<p>
							Unity 2D roguelike game with inspiration from Vampire Survivors.
							You play as a lonely survivor who has to fight his way through hordes of enemies in a never-ending battle.
							You can pick up different weapons and power-ups to help you on your journey.
							Then, once you are strong enough, you can face the boss and claim victory!

						<h2>Project B</h2>
						<p>
							Project B is my thesis project, where I developed a multiplayer game using Monogame and SignalR.
							The main goal was to create something using backend, frontend, database, and testing.
							It's a 2D game where you are able to run around and see other players in real time.
							Although the game is simple, the goal was to demonstrate the use of SignalR in a game.
							The server is hosted on Heroku, and the database is MongoDB.
							I used Docker for deployment and GitHub Actions for CI/CD.
							Although the server is currently down, you can still download the client and play it offline locally without issues.

						<h2>OpenGL Snake</h2>
						<p>
							A very simple snake game made in C++ using OpenGL.
							This was my first project using OpenGL, and I learned a lot from it.
							As I was learning OpenGL from https://learnopengl.com/ I wanted to make something simple to test my skills.
							This project helped me appreciate the tools provided by modern game engines and helped fundamentally understand how games are made.
							To play the game, you are required to locally compile the project using Visual Studio or any other C++ compiler.

						<h2>Project X</h2>
						<p>
							A group project where we created a cmd/terminal RPG game in C# using.Net, MariaDB, and Dapper.
							The main goal was to create something challenging as we were limited by the terminal.
							You play as a hero who battles in the arena and earns gold based on his performance.
							You can buy weapons and armor to help you in your journey.
							The game is played in the terminal and is controlled by keyboard inputs.
							I later refactored the game to use Docker with Evolve to start the MariaDB server.
							NOTE: If you wish to play the game, you require Docker to run the MariaDB server.
